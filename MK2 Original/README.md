# Acorn Advanced ROM MKII Original

Recently picked up something called an Advanced ROM MKII Adaptor, a 16K sideways ROM- RAM Adaptor for The Acorn Electron by Advanced Computer Products. The one I have looks like the one below, unfortunately it was had no sockets so both all the ROMs were soldered in and the jumpers used to select the type of chips installed (8K SRAM, 8K ROM or 16K ROM) were nowhere to be seen so not the most exciting piece of kit in my collection. So I decided to redraw the [schematic](https://github.com/tebl/Acorn-Advanced-ROM-Adaptor/raw/master/MK2%20Original/export/MK2%20Original.pdf) for the board, which explains this section of the project, instead of hacking up the cartridge to make it fit my own entertainment purposes.

# Schematic
The supplied KiCad files should be sufficient as a schematic, but it is also available in [PDF-format](https://github.com/tebl/Acorn-Advanced-ROM-Adaptor/raw/master/MK2%20Original/export/MK2%20Original.pdf).
